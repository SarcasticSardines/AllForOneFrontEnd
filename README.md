+ Create a website with 10 additional pages. Each must connect to one of the 10 API endpoints created earlier. Must be designed, be able to fetch api data, and have mobile and desktop responsiveness.

+ Review: The website design is simple but really nice! The Home page is great, but the pages for the individual challenges are certainly unique. The Api does not function at all, however, so the website has no functionality. In Avery's defence, I did try to help her with her Api issue. In the last 30 minutes. Oh Well.
